    "longdescription": "EFI Resolver is a Binary Ninja plugin that automates the task of resolving EFI protocol type information, which supports both DXE drivers and PEI modules. It propagates EFI related pointers from entry point to where they are stored, (e.g. system table, MM system table, boot services, and runtime services). For PEI files, it also support identifies processor-specific PEI service pointers. The plugin also identifies references to the boot services, PEI services and MM protocol functions and applies type information according to the GUID passed to these functions. The plugin supports the core UEFI specification by default, and allows users to provide custom GUIDs and protocols.",
